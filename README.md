# Pimoroni Grow 2024

This repo contains modified instructions for Pimoroni's Grow kit, as the latest software updates mean the original instructions don't work right out of the box. 

You can view the rendered HTML via https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Constructor-University/Pimoroni-Grow-2024/blob/main/Getting%20Started%20with%20Grow.htm

Thanks to Pimoroni / the original author Hel Gibbons for allowing me to modify the instructions.
